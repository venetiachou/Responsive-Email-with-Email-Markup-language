## Responsive Email with Email Markup language 📬

This is a series of emails I designed for the use of my company.

One thing to be mentioned is that I used **Email Markup language** and **responsive format** for the better user experience.

```It's all in details.```

In addition, I recommend MJML for those who want to create responsive emails rapidly, especially for designers.

```As the saying goes, Sharp tools make good work.```

## About me 👩‍🎨
Hi, I'm Venetia, a flawed product designer who aims to the one devoted to building products which not only solve people's problems but make people fulfilled and be what they truly are.

Currently my goal is to be a **full-stack designer**. I've learned coding since March 2018. Here[https://github.com/venetiachou/code-it-now-or-never] is all of my leaning outcome and process.

  Live and learn.
